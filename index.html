        <h2>Welcome!</h2>
        <p>
            I am a fourth-year transfer student in my second year at UCSC, majoring in Art with a focus on Graphic
            Design. My main artistic interest is printmaking, but I am working to develop my skills in graphic design,
            as that is the career path I plan to pursue.
